                            <br>
                            There are four seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, each presenting their own challenges and seasonal bosses.</p>

                        <h1 class ="margins">Autumn</h1>
                        <p class ="marginsp">Autumn is the first season and therefore the safest, allowing players to prepare for the harsh challenges ahead.  Players do not have to worry about freezing or overheating.  Days are longer, crops grow, and food is easier to find.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The seasonal boss for Autumn is Bearger, but he will not spawn in the first Autumn.  Players must survive a full year to encounter Bearger.

                    <div class="text">
                        <h1 class ="margins">Winter</h1>
                        <p class ="marginsp">Winter comes after autumn and is incredibly challenging for novice players.  Nights are longer and the player must stay warm to avoid freezing to death.  Plants stop growing and many creatures stop being active, making it difficult to find sources of food.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If players survive two-thirds of the season, they are greeted by Deerclops--their first seasonal boss.  Deerclops destroys structures, so be careful to keep them away from your base.  Deerclops also has a terrible drain on the players sanity.

                        <h1 class ="margins">Spring</h1>
                        <p class ="marginsp">After Winter comes Spring.  In Spring, it rains very frequently which is qute difficult for players to manage if they don't find a way to stay dry.  Being wet drives players insane, which causes nightmare creatures to spawn and attack players, and wetness lowers their body temperature, which can lead players to freeze.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Watch out for Moose/Goose and her Moslings in the Springtime.  Moose/Goose will protect their hatchlings at all costs and if you defeat them, their babies become enraged and attack you.  Furthermore, Moose/Goose has a honk attack that can force players to drop their equipped items and their Moslings can summon thunderstorms.

                        <h1 class ="margins">Summer</h1>
                        <p class ="marginsp">Summer follows the Spring in Don't Starve Together.  Plants will wilt and require fertilization in order to regrow.  Food spoils faster.  Players must take care not to overheat, which is slightly more difficult than trying not to freeze.  Furthermore, spontaneous wildfires can occur if players do not have Ice Flingomatics set up.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        Antlion spawns in the Summer.  They are a stationary boss that requires the Desert Goggles to find as you must brave the sandstorm in the Oasis Desert to locate them.  If you do not slay or appease them with trinkets within a set time period, they will cause sinkholes or cave-ins to occur wherever the player is located.
